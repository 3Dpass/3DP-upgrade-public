# 3DPass Node official upgrade version
This is an official [3DPass Node](https://github.com/3Dpass/3DP) release created especially to ensure the network stability, while transitioning to the Grid2d_v3a algorithm. 

The upgrade includes:
- Important security fixes
- Migration to Grid2d_v3a for miners (SOLO and mining pool trait)
- Mining pool trait fixes
- Atomic swap feature, which comes after the migration
  
## This is a major upgrade, which is mandatory for everyone! 
 
- The upgrade period: 2 days (by February 7th, 2024)
- All the nodes ignoring the upgrade will not be able to overpass the migration
- All the validators ignoring the upgrade will be removed out of the validator set with the penalty of 20000 P3D
- The sourcecodes will be released after the migration is completed

We hope, 3DPass community will support this important security upgrade.

## Upgrade your nodes! 

Sincerely, 
3DPass team
